a. What is an issue?  
   An issue is a feature or bug tracking system used in software development projects. 
b. What is a pull request?  
   A pull request (PR) is a way to propose changes to a repository hosted on platforms like GitHub. It allows contributors to notify others about changes they've made in their branch and ask for feedback or review before merging those changes into the main branch.

c. How do I open up a pull request?  
•	Create a new branch from the main branch.
•	Make your changes in that branch.
•	Push your branch to the repository.
•	Go to the repository on GitHub.
•	Click on the "Pull requests" tab.
•	Click on the "New pull request" button.
•	Select the base branch (usually the main branch) and the branch containing your changes.
•	Review the changes and add a title and description for your pull request.
•	Click on the "Create pull request" button.

d. Give me a step by step guide on how to add someone to your repository.  
•	Go to your repository on GitHub.
•	Click on the "Settings" tab.
•	Click on "Manage access."
•	Click on the "Invite a collaborator" button.
•	Enter the GitHub username, email, or name of the person you want to add.
•	Click on the "Add" button.

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?  
   Git is a distributed version control system that allows individuals or teams to track changes to files and collaborate on projects locally. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides additional features like issue tracking, pull requests, and collaboration tools, making it easier for teams to work together on projects.

f. What does git diff do?  
   `git diff` is a command-line tool used to show the difference between changes in files. It compares the changes between the working directory, staging area, and the last commit. 

g. What is the main branch?  
   The main branch is the primary branch in a Git repository. 

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?  
I will definitely not recommend to push changes directly to the main branch, especially in collaborative projects. Instead, we should create a new branch for our changes, push the branch to the repository, and then open a pull request for review. This allows for better collaboration and ensures that changes are reviewed before being merged into the main branch.
